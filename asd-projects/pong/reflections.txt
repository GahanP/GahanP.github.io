User Story / Gameplay:

Describe the gameplay
Players have to try to hit the ball with pads. If you miss, then the opponent gets a point. 

What are the conditions when the game begins?
Two pads are against the wall and a ball is in the middle. 

Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
Yes, the game ends when a player gets 5 points. 

What ifs will there be?
If the pad does not hit the pad, the opponent recieves a point. If the ball touches the pad, it bounces off to the other
side. If a player gets 5 points, the game ends. 

Visual Game Components:

What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
Two pads, a ball, and the score list. 

Which will be static? (the board)
The board and the score are static.

Which will be animated? (the box)
The ball and the pads are animated.

What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
I would have to manage positionY, positionX, speedX, speedY, and points. 

Events / Logic:
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
Keyboard events will occur in this game. 

How do those events affect the data of the program? For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
For example: in bouncing box, when the box is clicked:
The speed is increased
The point total goes up by 1 and is displayed on the box
The position of the box is reset to 0
The keyboard event moves the pads so that they can hit the ball.  The key up event makes the pad stop moving.
